# ðŸ’»Personal Website
Personal website built using GatsbyJS, a blazing fast static website generator based on React and GraphQL, deployed on GitHub Pages, and hosted on my personal domain. The website is live at https://www.agamjolly.com/

You may use my website as a starter template for other projects or under the MIT license. 

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/).

# Installing 

Clone the template using:

```sh
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```
